# 2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells

There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must do the following routine for `n` minutes:

- At the first minute, color **any** arbitrary unit cell blue.
- Every minute thereafter, color blue **every** uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Return the number of **colored cells** at the end of `n` minutes.
